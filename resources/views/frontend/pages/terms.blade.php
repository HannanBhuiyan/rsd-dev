            <p>We collect two basic types of information from you: (1)

              PII is any information that you supply to us that can
              individually identify you. PII includes, among other things,
              your name, contact information (e.g., email address, postal address, telephone number)
              and payment information. Non-PII includes information that does not personally identify you.

              information in at least three ways, including: directly from our Web Server logs, from Cookies, and from Users.
